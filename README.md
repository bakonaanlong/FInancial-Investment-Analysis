# Financial Investment Dashboard  


---

## 1. Background and Overview

This dashboard presents a comparative analysis of five high-potential side hustles: **E-Commerce**, **Crypto Trading**, **Content Creation**, **Freelancing**, and **Stock Market Investing**. The data is aggregated from a cohort of verified participants who reported earnings, time investment, and perceived cognitive load over an 11-month period (January to November 2024). This data was visualized in Ms Excel

The primary objective is to provide actionable intelligence for individuals seeking to optimize supplemental income streams. Metrics are normalized across participants to ensure fair cross-category comparison. All revenue figures are reported in **USD** and represent *average monthly reported revenue* per active participant.
 
**Key Stakeholders**:  
- Aspiring side-hustlers  
- Career transition planners  
- Financial educators and coaches  
- Policy analysts studying the gig economy

## 4. Insights Deep Dive

![yessir boy!](https://github.com/bakonaanlong/FInancial-Investment-Analysis/blob/main/trw%20dashboard.JPG)

### 4.1 Revenue Trajectory & Seasonality
- **E-Commerce**: Steady growth from ~$1,000 (Jan) to ~$4,200 (Nov) — strong Q4 surge.
- **Content Creation**: Exponential growth; November peak likely driven by holiday sponsorships and viral content cycles.
- **Crypto Trading**: High volatility; mid-year dip (May–Jul) correlates with market correction.
- **Freelancing & Stock Market**: Relatively flat — indicative of skill/investment ceiling without scaling.

### 4.2 Time Efficiency
```
Revenue per Hour (Approx.):
┌────────────────────┬────────┐
│ Content Creation   │ $53    │
│ E-Commerce         │ $31    │
│ Freelancing        │ $8     │
│ Stock Market       │ $5     │
│ Crypto Trading     │ $6     │
└────────────────────┴────────┘
```
*Content Creation dominates efficiency due to asynchronous income (ads, affiliates, royalties).*

### 4.3 Cognitive Load vs. Return
- **High Load, Low Return**: Crypto Trading & Stock Market (>8.5 load, <$1,800/month).
- **Low Load, High Return**: Content Creation (5.78 load, up to $5,500).
- **Balanced**: E-Commerce (moderate load, strong scalable returns).

### 4.4 Participation Scale
- **Freelancing** attracts the largest cohort (3,633) — low barrier to entry.
- **Crypto Trading** has the smallest (1,064) — likely due to risk aversion and regulatory uncertainty.
